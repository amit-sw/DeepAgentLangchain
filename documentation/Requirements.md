# Requirements: Migrate `app_autogen.py` to Microsoft AutoGen

- Goal: Replace LangChain agent usage in `app_autogen.py` with Microsoft AutoGen agents while preserving current Streamlit UX and behavior.
- In scope:
  - Implement AutoGen agents (assistant/tool-executor) to perform current research flows.
  - Maintain environment/secret loading from `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and env vars.
  - Keep logging behavior with configurable levels and destinations.
  - Preserve UI contract with Streamlit (inputs, progress streaming, final output string).
  - Use OpenAI-compatible models already configured in the project.
- Out of scope (for this change):
  - Refactors to `app.py` (LangChain-based), unless required for shared utilities.
  - Non-agent UI redesign.
- Functional requirements:
  - Users can run the same research query and receive a final report.
  - Intermediate updates are streamed to the UI (tool/agent steps).
  - Errors are handled and surfaced clearly in the UI and logs.
- Non-functional requirements:
  - Clear, structured logs with levels (debug/info/warn/error) that can be switched.
  - Minimal new dependencies; pin versions in `requirements.txt`.
  - Easy local run via `streamlit run app_autogen.py`.
- Success criteria:
  - Feature parity with current behavior.
  - No breaking changes to existing secrets/config.
  - Documentation updated (PRD, EDD, Deployment, User Guide).
